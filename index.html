                    <p><span>READY TO LIVE ON MARS?</span> 
                        It could become an option soon, if SpaceX CEO Elon Musk succeeds in building a self-sustaining city on the Red Planet.  
                        This city would be open to regular people, not just scientists and researchers.</p> 
                        
                    <p>As we know, moving to a new place can be stressful and expensive. 
                        Moving to a new planet can be that and a lot more complex.
                        Let us help you think through some logistics you'll come across with any move. 
                        Afterwards, we'll do the heavy lifting of calculating ballpark pricing for the move in an instant. 
                        Knowing this figure can inform you about whether you're on track to making this happen. </p>
                    
                    <h1>Inspiration</h1>

                    "Space Adventure: The Arrival of Man on the Moon", a full-scale recreation of an Apollo moon landing, will make its touring exhibition debut at Maurice A. Ferr√© Park in downtown Miami, Florida on April 7, 2022. Channeling our own Elon Musk vision, we look forward to the arrival of civilization on Mars.

                    <p>The screen is split into two columns. On the left side, provide information about a move you might make. On the right side, we'll lay out our logic for calculation. What are you waiting for?</p>
